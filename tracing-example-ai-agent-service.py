'''
This script demonstrates how to use the Azure AI Foundry Observability SDK to create, interact with, and trace an AI agent for financial education purposes.
Key functionalities:
- Configures OpenTelemetry tracing and Azure Monitor telemetry collection for observability.
- Initializes an AIProjectClient with Azure credentials and project endpoint.
- Checks and configures Application Insights for telemetry.
- Creates a financial education agent with specific instructions and disclaimers.
- Creates a new conversation thread and sends a user message about mortgage types in Switzerland.
- Initiates a run for the agent to process the message and polls for completion.
- Lists all threads and messages associated with the agent, printing out the conversation.
- Cleans up by deleting the created agent.
Requirements:
- Azure SDK for Python (`azure-ai-agents`, `azure-ai-projects`, `azure-identity`, `azure-monitor-opentelemetry`)
- OpenTelemetry Python SDK
References:
- https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/ai/azure-ai-agents/samples/sample_agents_basics.py
Environment Variables:
- AZURE_TRACING_GEN_AI_CONTENT_RECORDING_ENABLED: Enables tracing of generated AI content.
Note:
- The script assumes Application Insights is enabled for the Azure AI Foundry project.
- The agent provides only general financial advice and always includes disclaimers.

            You are a friendly AI Financial Education Agent.
            You provide general financial advice and education, but always:
